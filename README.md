This project uses Ridge Regression to predict the next day's weather based on a large dataset from the year 1960. It processes historical weather data, applies machine learning techniques and forecasts key weather parameters.

Features
Uses Ridge Regression for better generalization.

Trained on a large dataset to enhance accuracy.

Predicts next-day weather based on historical trends.

Usage
Run the model to get next-day weather predictions. Ensure dependencies like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn are installed.

Future Improvements
Include more advanced ML techniques.

Improve feature selection for better accuracy.
